# Readable Project

Readable Project provides a blog-based interface that allows a user to post and comment his or her own blog. All the blogs are organized into the following three categories:

A
A
* React
* Redux
* Udacity

MyReads Project also provides an interface that allows a user to vote his or her own posts and comments.

## Quick Overview

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MacauWinston/reactnd-project-readable.git
cd reactnd-project-readable
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.

(As you may notice, a token string of length 8 has been storied in your localStorage. This token represents your identity. Therefore, the next time when you restart the app using the same web browser, the same information will likely appear on the screen.)

Enjoy!
